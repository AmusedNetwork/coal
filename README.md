# Coal Programming Language
**[print: “Welcome to Coal!”]**

Coal is an interpreted programming language. It has a modern, highly verbose and object-oriented syntax.

Although some of its aspects resemble Objective-C, Coal is *not* a C-derived language.

## Documentation

You can read the online documentation at [this link](http://10c8.github.io/coal).

Another source of documentation is the standard library, located at `stdlib.py`. Everything in Coal is an object, so most of the language is implemented there.

## Installation

Getting Coal to work in your environment is easy and can be done through several ways:

#### Via `pip`:
```
$ pip install coal
```

#### From source:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/coal-lang/coal
$ cd coal
$ python setup.py
```

Once Coal is installed, you can check the version with:
```
$ coal -v
Coal 0.33
```
